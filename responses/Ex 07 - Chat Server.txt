Chat Server

A server chat would consist of chat rooms and threads (text chat).
The salons and threads can be private, except the general chat room and general thread.
Authorized users have the option to add new users and allow them access to chat rooms and threads.
Each user can switch from living room and access any thread (read and write) if he is allowed access.
